## YAML tools

These are just a couple of tools I spun up really fast to help
me swap JSON to YAML and YAML to JSON respectively. You need
to have Ruby >~ 2.3 installed. I'll make a proper package out
of this someday, but for now, the only gems required 'json' and
'yaml', which are part of base. These should work out of the
box. If they don't, please submit a PR:
